## Microservices Projects

A simple and straightforward project to practice what I've been learning about Back end development and APIs.  
To build this project I used the Express - Nodejs web framework, and Heroku.  
Here I did two small projects in one.

If you click [here](https://immense-eyrie-58582.herokuapp.com/), you're gonna see the Timestamp API project.  
And [here](https://immense-eyrie-58582.herokuapp.com/req-header-parser), you're gonna see the Request Header Parser API project.

These projects are part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
